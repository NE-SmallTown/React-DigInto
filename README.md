# React-DigInto

# Motivation

Seven months ago(2017.3) I start wanted to dig into react src code, but at that time react@16 is still developing and the
src code changed very frequently so I have to give it up.

But with the react@16 release formally, I think it's the time to restart this work :)

# Docs

Currently I just start the work, so the docs are just for back up.

The src directory are used for explore the src code expediently.

Now I will just put the [flow chart]((https://github.com/NE-SmallTown/React-DigInto/tree/master/docs/flowChartOfReactSrcCode.svg)) to the docs.But if I complete my work, I will try my best to write a artcile(maybe gitbook?)
to explain all things in detail.
